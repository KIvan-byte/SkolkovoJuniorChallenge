Assignment:

You need to develop software to increase the informativeness of cybersports broadcasts, according to the concept presented in the first stage of the Olympiad.
The software product must process the collected data and on its basis obtain indicators that will be visualized and integrated into the cyber sports broadcast.
Before developing, read and follow the specifications.

Specifications:
1. Metrics must be calculated reliably (the program must provide for the processing of at least 1000 readings of the same type).
2. The program should run for at least 5 minutes without degradation of performance over time (work steadily, i.e. no lags/delays/data loss, during a 5 minute game/broadcast).
3. OBS Studio can be used only for broadcasting (or recording to a file), overlay visualization on the picture of the game must be implemented outside of OBS Studio.
4. Getting data - in the variant of capturing keystrokes and the cursor through the WinAPI functions. We advise you to stick to the data format of the first stage.
5. Data processing as it comes, calculation of the main metrics for display.
6. Overlaying the received metrics on the game image.

Before sending the task for verification, make sure that your solution works not only on your PC, but also runs on a third-party PC. 
After 10.04.2021, teams may send additional questions to the assignment developers, if necessary.

A team representative should send the following files to the jury: 

1. an archive (in .zip format) of the developed software product and its source code.
2. instructions on how to launch the software product and compile the source code files (in .pdf format)
3. Video demonstrating the functionality of the software product (in any format, for example, avi, mp4, etc.).
4. User manual (in .pdf format) of the software product.
